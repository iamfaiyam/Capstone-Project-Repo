Me saying this is that anyone who see this fo with spotify they are very good and the memberships can be worth your wild if you want the full benefit im very happy that spotify is still here and in my opinion this music app is lowkey the best it saved me in rough times with providing music with little adds thank you from the bottom of my heart Spotify and thank you devs.,5,0,8.9.64.548,2024-08-14 18:22:07,8.9.64.548

So I have noticed this thrice now that Spotify will give an ad and would claim to give 30 mins free but within after playing 3 songs and barely 12 mins are over and you would get another ad. Seriously stop claiming things if you can't keep your word. Maybe just discard the whole app. Turning into a horror with every update.

I can't believe this company will go so far just for some money( ignoring the fact it's the biggest and, I mean, biggest streaming app). Limiting every possible feature there is. Want to see lyrics? You need to get Premium. Want to skip a part of a song? You need Premium. Want to literally play a song on the search? You can't directly without getting Premium. Want to skip a song?? You can't after 6 skips an HOUR or you need to buy Premium. Disappointed",1,0,,2024-08-14 00:05:30,
