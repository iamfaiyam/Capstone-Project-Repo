2021-05-06 05:15:15,"This feature has been one of the most annoying aspects of WhatsApp.

Everytime you download WhatsApp on your device, you are always subject to the default settings when saving your data on your device

One of this features is how by default WhatsApp will download any image or video shared in any conversation which you are apart of into your camera roll photo album.

This results in images and video which I do not possess appearing into your camera roll.

The reason why I don‚Äôt like this is because you are not in control of what people share and it doesn‚Äôt mean you want their content saved in your camera roll.

It‚Äôs particularly annoying with GIFs or Memes which are not actually funny and rather offensive.

I would like Facebook INC to change this feature to do not download all images and video from conversation as the default preference.",5,False,Keanu De Sousa,Change the default setting of automatically downloading all images into your photo album for on iOS,

Also you should add a camera simble next to all the chats so you can just click on that and send a specific photo to each chat, instead of changing it in settings every timeüò´ another good reason is because Snapchat is 17+ or something so basically no one is allowed it, if you include these simple things then it might just be the next big app, isn‚Äôt that what you want???

2023-08-14 05:42:16,"Hi WhatsApp,
This app is really great, I use it everyday and is exactly what I need! It is a basic app for messaging, but with so many advanced features!
 However, I think a really good improvement for this app would be to have information on photos you send. So if you click on your photo either on a chat or status, you can find out who saved or took a screenshot of it. This would be very beneficial for many users, and enhance the app even more! One more thing that would be great to be able to do is delete photos, even if everyone has viewed it. Every person I‚Äôve talked to wants this feature, and it would be helpful for personal, non business related chats. So once everyone has viewed it, you could still go back and delete it before more people save it. I would love to see these as an addition for WhatsApp, as it is such a great app!

2021-05-17 12:46:14,"Hi developers! 
WhatsApp is super useful, it‚Äôs my go-to messaging platform. I use it almost daily, and have rarely ever had problems with it. Clean, simple, easy to use, aesthetically pleasing interface, WhatsApp is great in a lot of ways. One of my issues with WhatsApp, however great it may be, is that the features regarding image sending and editing is extremely simple. I understand that you don‚Äôt want to make it too complicated, it is a messaging platform and not an art platform after all. However, I‚Äôve noticed that when trying to mark up images and draw on them I‚Äôll often have a particular colour that I used that I want to reuse, but there is no tool to grab a colour and use it again, and this has been quite frustrating. 

I‚Äôm not saying that you should incorporate extravagant colour pickers or a way to save old colours, that‚Äôs unnecessary. I just think it would be extremely beneficial to include a button (perhaps an eye dropper) below the colours that you can use to pick colours from an image or previous lines to match.

2023-09-21 00:36:47,"Hello Team,

We now have Disappearing Messages feature in WhatsApp, where we can set the older messages to auto-disappear after a certain time duration.

In Group Chats, once it is set, this gets set for the complete group, I.e., all members of that group. Now, a certain Group Chat can have LESS importance for few Members, and can have MORE importance for other Members. Members in first category want the messages to Disappear, but the members second category do NOT want the messages to Disappear.

So, suggestion is, is it possible to enhance the feature, so that individuals in the Group Chat can set their own Message Disappear timeline preference based on their need, without affecting the other members of the group. It‚Äôll be similar to ‚ÄúDelete For You‚Äù and ‚ÄúDelete For Everyone‚Äù options available while deleting a post in the Group Chats.

I look forward to getting reply on this and providing sone solution.
