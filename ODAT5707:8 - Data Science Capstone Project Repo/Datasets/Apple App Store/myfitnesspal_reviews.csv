My main annoyances are that little consideration has been given to those of us outside the US. The nutritional information on our food is different, and aside from letting us dig through the settings to switch back and forth between cal and kj (why can‚Äôt we just toggle between these in the info entry fields?) there are some annoyances when it comes to manually adding new items. For example, if the exact amount of certain nutrients is listed on the packaging, but MFP only accepts % of DI, I have to calculate that before I can add it. Certain nutrients and vitamins there isn‚Äôt even an option to add. Etc etc. Also the search function is a bit funky, often it gives too results that are barely similar to what I type, when there are almost identical (or completely identical) results buried way down the list. There‚Äôs also no way to correct foods that have incorrect serving sizes. If someone‚Äôs added wrong info for that barcode, good luck, you‚Äôll have to make a custom meal and search for it every time. For no good reason other than they don‚Äôt care.

The barcode scanner is great, and if the product isn‚Äôt there - you can add it. (Please include everything on the nutritional panel, guys) One thing that would help is if people would check their spelling when adding products to the lists, as these become available to us all and can make searching difficult. 

Absolutely love the recipe and meal features. You can add a favourite family recipe - and it will calculate how many calories per serving. I recommend keeping it to weight/per gram, so you can weigh your portion and get the true caloric value. 

In hindsight, it seems that the best way to get results it is to track your planned food BEFORE you eat. There are some sneaky calories out there!

I‚Äôve recommended the app to several people, I like the diary sharing option (with password) which can help with accountability and partnering on your health journey.

Hey guys just a heads up turn off Auto Updates for this App. Do not update it - will still work the same!

Some features removed with the latest update:
-Extremely invasive banner and pop-up ads
-No opting out if Recipes, Workouts and Plans. I think MFP is moving more toward a lifestyle app more than a calorie counter. Which you are forced into with the latest update.
-Meal sizes appear as only fractions in grams no more decimals when changing serving size
-No more weekly view of macros
-Search function is slower and less options. You have to keep re-entering your search word of the food and click search rather than auto searching with word input.

No added sugar but has real cranberry and whole nuts. That puts me into the red. So fruit juice and a banana or anything gives you a large red circle. I was suffering huge low energy and other things. My Dr notes i had stopped any sugar in coffee and no softdrinks but was also avoiding natural yogurt and fruit. So my natural sugars where so low it was causing problems and blood test showed such low iron these are now being addressed. Which he did blame the program. Due to my ptsd and going from terrible diet to good foods but seeing the big red circle and over the daily recommendation. Concerned him that this with others especially younger people in sports would choose the program. With out seeing natural fruit sugars and milk sugars where being added to sugar in general. So this should be adapted to a level to include all sugars including natural yet given a number that was a nutritional level. So yes added sugars are best to avoid but food sugars are in most things. So even two tea spoons of added sugar is not overdoing it. Honey better. But there is nothing regarding this. Which could lead to health problems.
