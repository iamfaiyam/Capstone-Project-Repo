2023-12-07 10:05:30,"For a social media website that dominates the online world, I’m amazed at how glitchy the iPhone Facebook app continues to be after years and years. From phantom notifications to the endless random faults in the pages section. The Facebook app often drives me up the wall. Editing events seems to be the worst part, the amount of times, I’ve spent hours writing a carefully thought out description, only for it to suddenly disappear when I go to save has meant that I now have to make sure I always copy text and take extra precautions to make sure all the details on events appear the way they are supposed to. Recently, they gleefully announced changes to the pages section and a profile/page switching option. Not much has changed for the better. All the parts that were glitchy are probably still glitchy. Now I seem to get twice the amount of notifications because I’m notified on both my profile and my pages which is quite annoying. As much as I appreciate Facebook for being a leading social media site, I’m still left feeling there is a lot to be desired about the way the application functions on my phone. It could be so much better! A user friendly simplicity seems to be lacking.

If you're looking for an unforgettable dining experience that combines amazing food quality, genuine hospitality, and authentic Indian flavors, look no further! I recently had the pleasure of visiting   Desi Dhaba melton  and I can confidently say that it exceeded all my expectations.

From the moment we walked in, we were greeted with warm smiles and exceptional service. The staff made us feel right at home, ensuring we had everything we needed to enjoy our meal. Their attentiveness truly enhanced our overall experience.

Now, let's talk about the food. Every dish we ordered was a delightful journey through the rich culinary landscape of India. The spices were perfectly balanced, allowing the authentic flavors to shine through in every bite. Whether it was the creamy butter chicken or the fragrant biryani, each dish was crafted with precision and care. You could truly taste the love and tradition in the cooking.

One pleasant surprise was how reasonably priced the meals were. For the quality and authenticity of the food, I expected to pay much more. The value for the delicious experience we had was simply outstanding.

Overall, I cannot recommend Desi Dhaba melton highly enough. If you're in the mood for authentic Indian cuisine served with outstanding hospitality, this is the place to be.

2023-12-28 05:35:17,"Facebook provides a very convenient platform on which to keep in touch with friends and relatives but not everyone whom I value is a member of Facebook. 

One difficulty I have is determining who is really sending posts and requests for friendship. In general I think it is safer to only accept as friends people who are already known to one personally or through other channels or contacts. 

The ease of use of Facebook compares favourably with other social media platforms. There are also mechanisms for reporting bad behaviour on Facebook, which is usually not committed by friends but by strangers who seem to hijack different Facebook groups. It depends on the diligence of the Administrators and Moderators of the Groups who control what is posted. Bad behaviour can also be reported directly to Facebook. 

Advertisements seem to be increasing in number and some appear to be targeted to what might interest the individual member, gleaned from what they have posted on social media. This is a trade-off that we might expect to have to agree to in order to have the convenience and scope of Facebook which is freely available to individuals.

My preference is to only post a small number of photographs or images with each post. Many people post large numbers of images in one post, but they have that choice available.

I have re-installed the app, logged out, reset my phone, updated the app etc etc but seems to be a larger issue (it also happens on my laptop)

It seems like this only happens to certain people. My partner can select “Most recent” and it will group all posts as you would expect but alas not for me.

I’m sure Facebook would be aware of this issue but nothing has changed in months, my feed just randomly decided to not group in chronological order over 2 months ago.

It just jumps around all over the place, 6 hours ago, 10 minutes ago, yesterday at 10pm... what the hell?!

I also have another problem where if I am scrolling my feed on my iPhone and accidentally swipe right a series of menus opens and then I cannot scroll back left to get rid of the menu instead I have to select “Most recent” again and it brings me right back to the start of my feed! Super frustrating if I am trying to check a few hours of posts.

Now I’ve tried fixing this issue also with no success. I have enabled and disabled certain “camera” settings still no go.

For someone who lives a long way from friends and family, Facebook is a great way for me to keep connected but now it’s becoming more and more isolating with the lack of posts I see from friends due to the significant and unnecessary amount of sponsored ads and suggested posts. Imagine for someone who is extremely depressed how isolating this must make them feel.

I truly believe people are being drawn away from this app now because of this and the fact it is so easy and common for people’s accounts to be hacked. It is also really hard to report a hacked account because there is no report feature for this!! Facebook needs to do better!

Like for one, I received a notification today letting me know an ad I reported was taken down as it violated the policy.. only to see it was a report I made back in November of 2019.. why the **** does it take 18+ months to review an ad that is reported??

Facebook marketplace is a rubbish and broken platform, why is it I list a rifle scope (completely legal to own here without licensing etc) and it gets taken down as apparently it’s against policy as it falls under weapons parts which is fair enough.. BUT when I find another local listing of someone else actually selling both the same part (rifle scope) as well as bullet casings eat, I report it and get the message “the listing wasn’t removed as it doesn’t violate community standards”. How hypocritical is this that. 

Oh and let’s not forget when a huge amount of scammers listed fake car adverts for cheap with outside linked emails and reports took 12-24 hours to remove each advert (our town had about 5-10 local scam listing a day).

2024-01-27 05:21:52,"I recently had the displeasure of using the Facebook app, which I can only describe as a digital wasteland. It's a breeding ground for security issues, with hackers seemingly having a field day. The lack of robust security measures is startling, making it feel like you're just one click away from a privacy nightmare. 

Navigation is clunky, and the user interface feels like it's stuck in the past. It's not just the aesthetics; the functionality is equally disappointing. The app is plagued with glitches and frequent crashes, making even the simplest tasks frustrating.

Moreover, the platform is overrun with misleading information and questionable content, which seems to be only loosely monitored. It's disheartening to see how it has strayed from its original purpose of connecting people, turning instead into a hub for chaos and uncertainty.

In summary, I cannot recommend the Facebook app in its current state. It's a shadow of what it once was, now a haven for hackers and a source of endless frustration for regular users.

2020-09-06 08:19:39,"Why is there no option to turn stories off. I’m not interested in that stupid feature so why can’t I turn it off? 
Also find it very annoying that videos play in my news feed yet I only get to see some of it before it stops then takes me else where if I ‘want to keep watching’
And then there’s the newsfeed itself. You never see your friends newsfeeds but see multiple adds blocking your feed. Still not sure why all these years down the track the newsfeed is never posted in a timeline.
So frustrating and just gets worse every time. And there’s definitely no need for an update every few days, it’s annoying as f.",1,False,Each update just gets worse,DeeDeeDuck
2019-12-21 01:27:22,"The social media app does nothing but promote trolling, egocentric  and narcissistic behaviours in people. It brings about the worse in us all. People ignore family and friends then I the same room as them and use it as a psychological sounding board where people are judged and ridiculed for having a difference of an opinion about everything. It’s just another way to control and program people and it’s stopping us from being who we are all meant to be and that’s to aim at being a better human race not the the complete opposite. The larger majority of people use Facebook for the wrong reasons and it divides us not unites us. It is an invasion of our privacy and human right to evolve as a spices and promotes angry not enlightened.",1,False,No stars if I could,Drew boo jacks
2019-12-09 21:15:00,"Over the last two or three updates I've had to delete then reinstall this app several times to get all the posts that have happened over night from the last time I looked at it.

It regularly skips from 1 hour ago to 9+ hours previous when loading and that's even with hitting the most recent option.

Please fix this because it's extremely irritating and if it continues I'll just be using facebook when I am at home on a desktop.

Edit:

Over the years I know that you guys have changed the algorithm to show the most liked posts. I’m honestly sick of missing things because I can’t have my news feed set to most recent rather than it skipping all over the time continuum. 

Please bring back the permanent option to set my news feed to “Most Recent” without either having to go through completely different menus or select it every time.

2018-04-27 02:34:17,"Recently I have not been able to access my mobile uploads or timeline photos. The albums are completely gone on the app and desktop site. Also when viewing a post I can only see two reactions (instead of the usual three) even if there has been three or more different reactions. I’ve also noticed when viewing other people’s profiles that I’m not friends with, I can now see private posts that are set to friends, but only when there’s someone else tagged in the post.

Would really appreciate it if these issues were fixed ASAP.",3,False,Bugs??,girlvoid

Also, the chapters are so short and limited.

The writer obviously need to proof read before releasing the chapter’s as there were scenes that have been very confusing and unrelated to the story in order to widen the story.",5,False,Marriage at First Sight,Terieta

The fact that I can’t get any support or help from one single person In your company because it’s a “free” service is disgusting . I can’t provide any proof of record ownership and can not re gain access to MY profile because there’s no email address to forward to , no number for me to contact and call someone  . Your reporting tools go around in circles . For such a high tech company your security and customer service is pathetic . If everything these days wasn’t on Facebook I wouldn’t have an account  .
