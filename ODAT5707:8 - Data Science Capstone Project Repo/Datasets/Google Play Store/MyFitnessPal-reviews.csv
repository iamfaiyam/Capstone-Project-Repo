3,08dd5a70-db96-4d86-b535-e9e47fa7185b,Painfully Focused,"It's actually a great app. I've been tempted to go premium, just so I can be lazy and scan barcodes instead of manually entering them. It connects to my fitbit to tell me how many calories I can consume when I've done any form of exercise and it tells you if you're under or over certain health goals in terms of protein, fat and so on. Myself and my partner fully utilise this app, to maintain a healthy lifestyle without adding another thing to compartmentalise and deal with. 10/10 would recommend",5,0,24.30.0,2024-08-14 19:55:36,24.30.0

6,8c69e256-e640-401d-a0b7-bd9779e5bc9e,Deborah Hadley,If you want me to buy premium though you need some perks. The premium stuff on offer is not worth a penny much less the obscene price you're trying to charge! The difference between the monthly and yearly price is ridiculous and insulting to people who can't afford to part with large sums at once. Have switched to Chronometer and much happier.,2,0,24.30.0,2024-08-14 14:42:09,24.30.0
