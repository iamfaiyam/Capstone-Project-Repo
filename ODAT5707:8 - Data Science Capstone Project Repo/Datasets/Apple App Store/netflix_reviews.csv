Netflix has multiple Genres and it’s perfect for the whole family all ages!! But Netflix has a past known to discontinue Amazing and Fun Series. So don't get your hopes up for series because Some may be continued and some discontinued But yes I highly recommend Netflix it’s fun for all ages!! But Netflix has a 5 limit on Profiles and I think the limit should be a bit higher as I am a 13 year old child and my single mother has 9 children, 4 have moved out because they are 18+ but in her household she has still 5 of her kids living with her who are 18- she also has herself so she has 6 people living in her house but only 5 Netflix profiles so 2 of us share an account and 4 of us don’t so Netflix is you read this please add a bigger limit to profiles!!

2024-03-27 04:55:43,"Everything had been working very well for years.   But then at the beginning of February 2024 I updated the app.  Big mistake!  Of course, the software designers have to mess around with things.  Don’t they always, in a pathetic attempt to justify their existence?  This time they took away the Downloads tab from the bottom of the screen, for reasons best known to them.  But that was nothing compared to the disaster they created.  All the downloads which I already had but which had expired, I was unable to renew them.  Forever and ever I was presented with the error message ""you have downloads on too many devices…""  This had never happened before.  Not only that, but I couldn’t download anything.  After many calls to customer service I had to delete all those downloads and start all over again.  That is the kind of outcome customrw are presented with when a company chooses to employ incompetent software designers.  Hours wasted because of app upgrades that are worse than useless.

Netflix spends a fortune on programming.  Well, it’s about time they made sure that any app upgrade is absolutely faultless before they present it to its overcharged customers.

If I could give this app zero stars I would.  One is too many.  The Prime Video app has always been much, much easier to use, and after this experience with the Netflix app I’ll probably delete my account.",1,False,Rubbish app,Freshwest
2021-12-31 12:26:21,"I loved Netflix (yes, it’s past tense), the catalogue was superb until today where suddenly the only catalog I have access to is the global catalogue a.k.a Netflix produced shows / movies only. Been a loyal customer for the past 2 years or so, this is the first time I use their online chat feature to ask for help as none of the available stock standard FAQ / problems in their website really apply to my case. 

First things first, I do have VPN and I understand that using VPN will cause Netflix to block the broader catalogue available in that region, I get it. The thing is I never used it whenever I watch Netflix. And by the way, the vpn is only available in my phone and laptop. There’s nothing in the router / smart tv. The thing that really puzzles me is that using my VPN, I was somehow able to access broader catalogue in my region. 

Of course I brought all of those information to the live chat agent, the response however was stock standard and there was a point where I felt like talking to a bot. The agent was simply shifting the problem to the ISP. At the very least I would expect he/she to tell exactly what my problem or why my account is getting blocked from accessing the broader catalogue. I think a bit more care to the customer is appreciated. I need to think of changing my ISP, if it solves my problem, great, if it’s not then it’s a lose-lose to both ISP and Netflix.",1,False,Poor Customer Service,rockinsky91
2022-08-22 22:51:36,"Netflix is one of my favourite apps so far! I recently got an apple iPad, and have been streaming Netflix like crazy! You can save episodes to watch them later when you don’t have wifi. For example if you’re in the car on a day trip you can just watch Netflix! It does take a while to save the episodes but it’s worth it when you’re watching.

I love Netflix but sometimes it glitches out and kicks me of the app, or if I’m watching it on TV it kicks me off the TV and just says “try again later” and shows a time. This happens frequently and it’s quite annoying. I get frustrated when Netflix isn’t working for me and I have to reset the whole system only for it to tell me to try again later.

But in conclusion, Netflix is a good app it just needs some updates now and then to make it easier for us to work it. Families love watching Netflix together, and I can see why. It’s a good source for anybody to be updated or just watch something fun.",4,False,Best App Ever!,I love cat 💕💕💕
2020-09-30 08:23:12,I love Netflix and all but every time I finish an anime there is no good ones because I’ve watched them all and it needs popular anime like attack on titan and Tokyo ghoul or HunterxHunter because all the anime’s I haven’t watched aren’t all that good and these anime’s are popular meaning they would be watched. more and more attention would head towards Netflix because maybe people that like anime like this can’t get anime watching apps but can get an app like Netflix and their favourite anime’s can be there to watch because if a weeb watches all the anime there and can’t find more they might as well drop the entire app because the stuff they like isn’t here. Or you can just make an entire anime setting where you include popular anime’s and other anime’s so we don’t have to go searching everywhere for it on the adult setting but if you do add an anime setting repeat after me DONT’T EVER delete an anime because it isn’t getting a lot of attention it could be someone’s favourite show and if they go to watch it it won’t be there so again they might drop Netflix this also goes to any other show. if you think no because what about other shows just make room for them or look at THEIR popularity so if it does go on Netflix it gets the attention so Netflix gets attention and more,1,False,It’s great but needs more anime,lazari_eclipse
2023-02-26 11:23:43,"While the UI has been crafted expertly for ease of use the underlying groundwork is full of gremlins. Despite the fact I have certain settings like autoplay next episode enabled it refuses to do so. Other times it will randomly delete or corrupt random episodes of a show or movie. I’ve even had it just outright crash a few times. Whatever is underneath the shiny exterior is in desperate need of cleaning up.

On the library side it’s hit and miss. A lot of good stuff is unavailable in Australian Netflix due to licensing (thanks Australian media monopoly) or just otherwise missing. A lot of older movies and shows are still available on here though which is nice.

Content quality wise, if it’s not made by Netflix it’s most likely good. Netflix has gone severely off a cliff the last few years and continues charging more. American social politics is rife in Netflix Originals to the point it becomes the Original’s identity. For things like anime they are injecting American social politics wherever they can when it didn’t exist in the spoken Japanese dialogue in the first place through the subtitles and just outright rewriting a dialogue scene just to fit it in english dub.",2,False,Put together nice but hides gremlins,NEK0M1M1
2019-10-12 13:44:24,"I love Netflix, it is great how there are different age group accounts you can pick from and you can have multiple accounts for the whole family. It has a wide variety of tv shows and movies, including Netflix originals. It is useful how if you  are watching a movie or show it has others films like it if you don’t know what to watch next. It’s good how it saves your progress in the movie/show. I recommend Netflix for anyone as it is great for all ages! I also love how you can download shows to watch if you are at a place that will not have connectable wifi. My only (personal) problem is that a show I was watching got taken down, I was watching it for weeks as it had many seasons but I hadn’t finished it yet and I was really upset because I cannot find it anywhere, so developers if you see this I’m really hoping if you could put How I Met Your Mother back on Netflix for a while please??

2024-08-14 04:23:48,"I loved netflix for a very long time but their recent changes on home internet connections and others really drove me away from them. We don’t have wifi at home cuz we all have unlimited data so our IP addresses are all different even when we live in the same house. When i contacted them via the live chat I just got a disheartening response where I honestly thought I might have just been talking to a bot. They just advised that even though I am paying for 2 devices, because of our different IPs only one person will be able to use the account and there was nothing else they could do about it. I understand that I am just one customer and losing just one obviously wouldn’t affect a multimillion dollar company in the least but it’s really sad to know that they don’t have (at least in my experience) good customer service and problem resolution teams. Also the fact that they didn’t seem to care one bit about my predicament when I had been a loyal customer of the service for quite a while really just made me realise how futile it all was continuing with them.",2,False,Disappointed…,nighthunter1206
2023-01-09 20:23:22,"So Netflix all in all is an ok streaming service. However, they will Greenlight a well-received show, and after about 2 seasons they cancel it well before any meaningful conclusion can be made. At the time of writing this inside job had just been cancelled and if it was just inside job I’d understand but they have been doing this to multiple shows where show creators create great shows only for them to be cancelled. The reason why this is a problem is that I find myself watching Netflix less and less as I find there’s no reason to watch a show and get interested when chances are it will be cancelled. And it seems unfair that shows such as big mouth, paradise PD and others get 6 or so seasons whereas other shows only get 2. Both shows are ok in their own right but it is my belief that the resources are being distributed unfairly amongst the shows. Netflix is by no means the only streaming service that does this but they are by far the worse perpetrator.

2021-05-03 20:54:06,"Personally, I love Netflix. It’s just a wide variety of movies, TV shows and more at your disposal. But there’s a couple of glitches I want to discuss.
The first one is that sometimes when I’m watching a show when I finish my episode it might cause something I call the ‘Set Episode Glitch’. Basically after finishing another episode when I press ‘Next Episode’ it goes to the episode that’s locked in the glitch. It eventually auto corrects itself about a week later.
Secondly, there’s the ‘Infinite Intro Glitch’. Sometimes when I press ‘Skip Intro’, it loads for a long time and then goes right back to the start. Then every button except the exit one brings it to the start again.
The last one is the ‘Forever Loading Glitch’ where after skipping the intro it has the loading icon, but this is more annoying than experience ruining.

2019-10-12 19:11:03,"Netflix is a great app and service, but it really needs to step up its game with the control of the app that it bestows upon the paying customer! I hugely dislike how when you finish watching a show it stays in the continue watching section even if you remove it from your list, and it is irreversible. It’s even worse when you start watching something that you don’t like and then it stays there forever, and even starting new shoes doesn’t shorten the list of shoes you are apparently “watching” - should you ever want to again but apparently not if you don’t! It just is cumbersome and not tailored to the customers interests that way. It needs to be updated to include a simple “X” option to remove the show out of the section, and the issue would be resolved. It’s the little things Netflix!

2023-09-02 11:09:58,"Poor cultural sensitivity. For a service with so many international shows you’d think Netflix would know the difference between people from Afghanistan & the currency of that country? Not so if you read the synopsis of Hyena Road? That’s poor & culturally offensive. 

Netflix want you to watch their stuff so badly, they cut credits before the end of the show & jump straight into something else. Too bad if you’re waiting for those end credit scenes, they’re cut too ☹️ Netflix also has a really poor “shows like this” algorithm!! It chooses by actor & not by theme. After watching the basketball movie “Coach Carter”, it found similar titles to be “John Q”, “8 Mile” & “American Gangster”?? Similar to what??? Finally, it would be great if Netflix stoped automatically starting random programs before I’ve found something I want to watch? If it had a decent search tool I could find programs faster.

2019-07-09 09:46:57,"I usually wouldn’t say anything but Netflix needs to improve. So many of my favourite shows are disappearing and some aren’t even there in the first place. I’m on Netflix au and have been scrolling through the internet when I notice that Netflix US has so many more shows where as I am limited to nearly nothing, and I understand that some Spanish or French shows have language barriers but is this really necessary? I would also like to talk about the fact that shows that I have previously watched/finished/discontinued watching are kept on a continue watching list and pop up constantly. These things should NOT be affecting my recommendations and it is irritating to see that the Netflix algorithm is this poor, especially if I have disliked the content.

So many to choose from! It is honestly very awesome! Please don’t read other reviews saying it’s bad or glitchy because it isn’t. It’s there fault… maybe they have a bad internet connection or they just have a terrible tv or device. It has wide ranges of different genres and movies and people are just complaining too much. Obviously Netflix doesn’t “have it all” well then just get another movie platform like hbo max aswell as Netflix so that you have an even bigger selection of movies and genres to choose from.

2019-06-09 07:37:43,"Do not buy this product it is insecure!!!!

I have been a Netflix subscriber since it started in Australia. I thought it was safe. I was so wrong. Within the last few months my account has been continually hacked from different people all over the world. I found that hackers have been selling my login details and some just throwing it out to people to use for free. The reason this is so alarming is they now, due to Netflix’s terrible security, have access to my email account which has sensitive information. They have payslips, security codes, address and photos of my children and family. This allows the hackers to create fake cards, visas etc..

I spoke to Netflix’s helpless call centre today and instead of working on a solution for the problem they just reset my password and told me that’s the best they could do. Didn’t want to leave their details as a point of reference and kept saying that this was their best. Well it’s not good enough. I now have to worry about what I have stored on my email and essentially delete or redirect any sensitive information due to Netflix’s poor security. 

I highly suggest not purchasing Netflix as it may cost you a lot more than $20ish a month. 

I have Stan, Foxtel and many other programs for my smart TV and none of them have given me any problems whatsoever. Only Netflix.

Secondly, I’d like to see Netflix introduce a feature where users can cast aside films that they may have previously watched either outside of netflix/through a different netflix account (so that it doesn’t constantly appear to be recommended) — this should be a separate list that users can easily access and view, i.e. “Watch History”.",3,False,Future features I’d like to see,UXFreak

I like to rewatch shows, especially sitcoms, but this new bug makes that impossible. Sometimes when I finish an episode in the middle of a season (when the rest of them are marked as watched), the app will act like i just finished the entire show and disappear from my watch list. But not only that, it also disappears from the search results as if it never existed. It usually reappears when the app is updated or randomly a few hours later. Sometimes it’s not just the one show, the entire sitcom genre disappears, excluding Netflix Originals, which makes it seem like maybe it was intentional?

If you can’t find something you like, cancel any time you want. 

That said, the reliability and stability of the app has been consistently poor over the 2+ years I’ve subscribed - most notably Chromecasting from the app and returning to it (having switched to another app) will most commonly result in the app being non response to pause/skip/subtitle change/etc. You have to force close the app to re-establish a connection.

Unfortunately I can’t understand 60% of the episode I’m watching because it’s in Spanish and there are no subs for the Spanish. Kinda pointless as far as communicating a story goes. It doesn’t matter what I do with the subtitle settings the Spanish simply isn’t translated. I’m noticing this more and more and I can’t say I’m impressed. With more and more shows using other languages to support their story (which is amazing and leads to better authenticity) why isn’t Netflix supporting this by providing subtitles to share the full story?,3,False,Subtitles,Nanao-chan81

Point 2: Stop removing the good movies!!
This title may seem a little vague but I’m serious!! There were some great movies on here but they got removed, I know this probably has to do with the contracts running out or some mess but Netflix needs to take into account what the viewers think.

The manually sort option is pretty bad too. Sometimes the list doesn’t even sort which is just pretty bad coding. Takes forever to sort things as well. Wouldn’t be hard allow users to manually sort their watch list.

In the “more like this” section, there used to be the ability to click each show, read the synopsis and add to my list.

My cous became pretty dang tense towards me, especially at family gathosz and plethoras of weddings. Hence fourth and foremost I will still continue my membership but begrudgingly so.......My suggestion to Netflix user/subscribers is to monopolise on romantic comedies (rom coms) and avoid fan fiction such as; vampires diaries, the twilight Saga etc. etc. To keep this plain and simple stay away from all vampire associated productions.

Other than that it is pretty good to watch shows or episodes with out internet. I just wonder why you can not watch ALL of them. It’s really a big bother because let’s say you were in W.A.

2019-12-04 07:37:49,Netflix is the best online app I’ve ever used. We’ve never had a problem with it whatsoever. There is nothing wrong with it. But the one thing I am sad about is that they keep taking movies off. When a movie has been released to Netflix. I would go and watch it. Then after awhile it goes onto their trending. Then it disappears. No one knows why or how it disappeared. But I think that is something that you need to improve. I don’t watch Netflix that much anymore. I have Disney+.

2. My favourite show is full house but it says it is only going to be available until May 31st. In my opinion I think shows should stay on forever so people don’t have to find a new show and so people can finish it.

2020-07-28 11:04:13,"Netflix is an awesome streaming app and it is wonderful to use. I have had been using it for a long time but there’s been a few major issues, but I will point out one. Every month, Netflix tends to delete lots of shows and movies and not bother to tell their audience. Many people want to know so they can watch it before it goes if you’re aware. These shows include the Harry Potter series, which is very popular world-wide. If your going to delete things, please remind the audiences. Other then that, Netflix is a flexible app. I hope you take this into consideration and thank you for this app.

2020-08-12 02:22:41,"Dear Netflix,

I would like to inform you that other people are not appreciating movies disappearing. You know, some of the shows are really good. I do not know why you need to disappear the shows and movies from Netflix. Like me, I really liked Big Bang Theory and F.R.I.E.N.D.S, Modern Family. Who cares if those shows are old, but they could be important to people. Please read all the peoples comments about Netflix. It would really help with them too. I did notice that UK and US have way more shows and movies they the Aussies do. I don’t understand why you did that. Maybe bring back some of the shows and movies. And please do not think I am a really angry person. I am justifying that you could change some things on Netflix.

2022-10-03 12:28:47,It’s great but the only thing I would say is that it need to have what’s coming soon like on the tv because it’s annoying that you have to look on the tv to see what’s going to be coming. Also when you watch something and finish it it doesn’t sit in continue watching and you don’t get “this is 98% match” because you watched the same genre like if u watch a war movie and you rate it thumbs down it will be in top picks for you like why.

Another thing I find annoying is when you start a new series the latest season is first so it goes 3,2,1 ect. So you have to scroll through all the seasons to get to the first one.
