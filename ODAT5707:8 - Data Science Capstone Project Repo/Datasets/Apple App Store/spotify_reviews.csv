First is to be able to see who has recorded a particular piece, then choose which soloist/conductor/orchestra/choir etc to download. At the moment there‚Äôs little choice, and it‚Äôs very difficult to see (at least on my iPhone 6s+ screen) who is featured. 
Second, when I am listening to something with a lot of movements I want to see quickly which one is playing- but the scrolling info is so slow that the screen goes back to sleep before the movement number goes across - or else it‚Äôs something like the Rachmaninov variations on a theme of Paganini, with 24 short sections and the movement is finished before its number reaches the screen. Can I set it to scroll faster? Or touch it to pause & enlarge to see all the info at once? 
Third thing is lack of important info like recording date & the other things mentioned above, ho was in he band for this recording etc

PROS:

Playlists based on your history help you discover new music that you‚Äôre likely to enjoy.

Regular updates to squash bugs and improve the experience.

HOW TO MAKE IT BETTER:
When changing the settings for a song (e.g. repeat), the button at the bottom of the screen should say ""Done"" instead of ""Cancel"" - you‚Äôre closing the settings, not canceling them.

Make the ‚Äúdon't like‚Äù button available on every song, just like the ‚Äúlike‚Äù button.
