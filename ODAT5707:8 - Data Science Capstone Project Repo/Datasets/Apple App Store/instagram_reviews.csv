I don't understand why the app does it but there would be no point in posting an image if it turns out blurry a week later. Also the same with Instagram stories 75% of the time they come out blurry when using other techniques to the image. Another issue that's very bothering is having multiple adds pop up a day.

When you follow so many pages or less, seeing multiple adds come up Especially after a busy day are becoming annoying when search down your feed.

2022-12-17 22:59:11,"Whilst Instagram is one of the social media platforms I prefer it does have some annoying features that are absent. The easiest that should be added is an indication next to a persons name as to whether they are one of your followers are not. Such a simple fix and could save a lot of time going through feeds. Another huge change that‚Äôs long overdue is the resolution and full screen viewing of photos. Come on already. The app is about sharing photos and we are still stuck with crappy cropped, low resolution photos that you can‚Äôt see in full screen. Stop trying to make Instagram what it isn‚Äôt with paying more attention to reels and get with what people want it for. Or sit back and watch other apps take over your space.

I add on to my review the number of restrictions Instagram automatically applies to peoples accounts. If you like and follow to many peoples pages (the entire point of Instagram) you get restrictions. If you try to manage your own account and unfollow or block to many people you get restricted. So whilst they make money from your creative content they restrict how you even manage it.",5,False,Madredmini,Needs a total overhaul!!!
2022-07-04 17:05:38,"Hi, I have non epileptic seizures (seizures that mimic epileptic seizures without sending electrical currents through the brain and instead is caused by something functional in the brain). Triggers for these seizures can include ‚ú®strobe lights‚ú®. Lately I have been coming across more and more videos that include strobe lights without the use of flash warnings and I usually comment to politely ask to add a warning however in some cases comments will be disabled or the creator with refuse to put a warning. I know that this isn‚Äôt Instagrams fault but I have some ideas to help reduce the risk of seizures from videos containing strobe. 

I feel as if Instagram should add a feature to report videos containing flash to hide the video from photosensitive viewers much like the warnings used for graphic material. This can help protect ourselves from future seizures and flair ups. I know that some people think this might be a dumb request ‚Äúthere aren‚Äôt warnings in the real world‚Äù ‚Äútoughen up and get over it‚Äù but the thing is that this IS the real world, we can‚Äôt get over it because that‚Äôs just our life. For some people no flash warnings can be a matter between life or death. You‚Äôre playing with peoples lives here. People with seizures have gone through so much trauma, experiencing seizures are terrifying no matter how many you may get.

2023-11-26 16:19:24,"My biggest issue with Instagram lately is their application of community guidelines. They seem very inconsistent and biased- strictly following the guidelines with some content but not other similar content, especially when it comes to ‚Äúpolitical‚Äù content... this can greatly affect what content you are allowed to see, comment on, post and share. The ‚Äúfact check‚Äù feature also seems to be bias on particular things.

Reporting content and comments that are not appropriate, especially things regarding bullying and discrimination, or fake/scam accounts pretending to be other people, seems to do very little most of the time, and nothing is usually done about the post/comment you report- only suggesting you block the person you have reported, which doesn‚Äôt always fix the issue. The process for reporting things like people stealing your content (copyright infringement) and/or invading your privacy, while generally more effective and successful than the conventional way of reporting things, is also much more difficult- it‚Äôs hard to find where and how to send reports directly this way, and is more time consuming. 

The live streams always seem to be glitchy and troublesome, both for the host of the lives and the viewers. Editing reels and stories can also be a pain, with additional features not always loading, things being out of time after uploading, sound playing but the video being frozen, or the app crashing all together and randomly shutting down.",1,False,Watermelon lover üçâ,Glitchy and inconsistent

instagram was my favorite app to use since it was the most simple, with not many changes and looked refined with the format posting and the dimensions. now with the full screen dimension the colors are just way to contrasting and chaotic. not to mention it doesnt make me want to keep scrolling. the white inbetween the posts on the home page was much better, and i honestly think the new version is atrocious üòÑ not to mention, the feed just looks out of place and doesn‚Äôt look good. for a multi billion dollar company i was expecting a much more refined and professional media design than what we got. although i understand that this might be a temporary design, i still think that it was muuuuch better before, and many can agree with me.",3,False,iits_becky,horrible update

I think the concept, what they have done in the social media sphere is amazing but I think there are ways we could make social media ‚Äúhealthier‚Äù.

The results can be that people end up not living their life because hours and hours are spent scrolling, addicted to their phone. I understand social media is a large part of how a lot of people make their income but for many, it is a way to keep in touch with friends and search up new friends, be artistic, post life updates, message and so on. 

I would love to see a function on Instagram in the settings that allows the user (or even parents of kids) to disable the discovery page function.

2024-07-05 03:24:07,"I am an avid instagram user and love the app. There are a few simple changes though which would vastly improve the UX for visual collectors. Change request 1) As a user who creates overlapping collections, I want Instagram to enable me to save a post to multiple collections without using a long hold of the save button and extra clicks. This is so that I don‚Äôt accidentally unsave my posts if my long click glitches (often the case) and so I don‚Äôt need to incorporate several extra clicks to save to multiple collections. Previously this was enabled for and it was so much better than the new meta version. 2) As a user who saves posts to multiple collections, I would love if Instagram could please change the save functionality to enable us to save the specific slide in a post as the cover slide in our saved collections as often the slides in a post have no correlation and the other slides are not relevant which muddles our saved collections. E.g. someone may have a dump of photos in a post and one has an outfit picture; another of flowers; family; kitchen etc and if the front is the family then it often has no correlation to a saved collection on ‚Äúoutfits‚Äù or ‚Äúinterior design - living spaces‚Äù.",3,False,natasha___,Saved Posts UX Please Fix

2019-03-02 03:04:09,"I‚Äôm not a huge fan of social media, however, Instagram is the one app I prefer using for my artwork aside from Tumblr. 
The photo upload quality both on the Instagram stories and posts could definitely use some work, though.

Another pet peeve is how Instagram is extremely demanding of your time. Not everyone likes to or can be active online so much, and it seems purposely designed (obviously) to make sure you log in and post everyday; otherwise your views and page visits go down. I don‚Äôt often finish a lot of my art in one day, it can take days or weeks and I struggle to get it seen when I post it as well; probably because of whatever algorithm you guys are using.

For years Instagram was updated but the core values and aspects of the app remained the same. Now we are forced to look at an interface that is confusing and unpleasant for the eye.

Myself along with other millions of users downloaded this app to socialise and share moments in our lives. Not shopping.

First of all I think before instagram does anything they need to check for potential adding of minors to possibly real or fake $3x chats on dm and also make sure that if there are minors on the app that they can stay safe and not get requests or groups with them

Secondly instagram needs to start checking accounts for kids that look 10 and under. I am always seeing little kids on instagram reels and they always get butchered in comments. What I‚Äôm more concerned about is what I said above with $3x bots when u have a public account u can easily follow someone but with private not so much. I just think that Insta needs to look out for minors because other you have hidden $3x bots and potential predators in their following.

So what I‚Äôm trying to say is that for minors on Instagram they should add something for just minors on private where Instagram can see accounts before they try to follow you so they know they can‚Äôt be potential $3x bots and if instagram sees any minors on a public account(10-5) in this case especially to maybe have a self private account that instantly turns the account private

Before, you could enjoy the images in all their glory, most of them carefully photographed and edited to look good just as they are. Then you could go on to read the text underneath, clearly readable on a white background.

Now, every image looks duller with the annoying shading at the bottom. You can‚Äôt see the image in it‚Äôs entirety when the caption is superimposed over the bottom section of the photo.

The rules set for this need to be changed! I understand it helps with stolen identities but in most cases it is very far from that! 
In no way were any of these accounts impersonating anyone!

The main group that has been affected is fan accounts. Fan accounts are accounts people make to express themselves and show their support to people who mean a lot to them. THERE IS NOTHING ILLEGAL OR WRONG ABOUT THIS! But still, thousands of accounts are being deleted. 

After all of my friends were deleted by accounts that report innocent fan accounts, I reported them and questioned some, only being told to end my life and some posted disgusting posts, posted about me.

Secondly, why is it so hard to report an issue?

Third, there isn‚Äôt any business help line. How can business placed trust in your app when there‚Äôs no live chat or personal hotline for urgent support?!

Others I've never met

Furthermore, Instagram's user experience has been plagued by a barrage of targeted advertisements, algorithmic biases, and fake accounts, making it difficult for users to trust the platform.
