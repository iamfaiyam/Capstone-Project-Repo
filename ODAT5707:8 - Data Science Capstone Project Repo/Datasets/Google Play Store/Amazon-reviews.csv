79,8e981dba-9fc2-46da-b8d7-5117e5587e4a,Brendin Rickert,If i could leave a 0 star rating i would i have used amazon for many years i started with them probably about 10 to 12 years ago. I have just found out they take 30 days to refund any money back the there shipment recievers but they are able to take you money in the matter of hrs. I am personally done with this company everything is more expensive then just going through the distributors also and if you go through the distributors vs. amazon there customer service is alot more understanding.,1,0,28.15.0.100,2024-08-14 03:31:21,28.15.0.100
80,f513ac20-de75-4b8c-996e-f58f22f154b0,Smith Antony,Dear friends i would recommend using flipkart instead of amazon. The amazons biggest scam is their prime membership. They say you will get an immediate next day delivery when you buy the prime. I fell in that trap. It was real emergency for me to buy a specific item and when you chat or talk with their agent they give fake promises. I am a frustrated customer and the customer care executives just sit there and assure they working on it and just leave as it is and nothing will be done.,1,0,28.15.0.100,2024-08-14 03:13:59,28.15.0.100
