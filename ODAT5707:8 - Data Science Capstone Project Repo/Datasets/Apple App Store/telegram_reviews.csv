2021-02-21 04:17:21,This app has all the edit functions I never thought of but am so grateful for now that I have them. They seem so natural and intuitive and make me wonder why WhatsApp never thought of them! I would have given the app 5 stars but there’s still a lot of work to do with the photo and video upload and download functions. For work I have that needs video and photo upload and download I have to ( reluctantly) use WhatsApp still as otherwise work gets disrupted. I am so happy there is an alternative to the aggressive and arrogant invasive ness of FB/WA. As soon as Telgram developers fix the video and photo upload/download glitches it’s goodbye to WhatsApp for ever from me!,4,False,Bratatii,Great edit functions,
2022-09-26 12:26:28,"I think having volunteer support people is not viable because there is no one we can contact for bugs to be fixed! There is no way for me to report a bug!  

Ever since premium became available and the most recent updates, I have had more issues in telegram than ever. Why do messages not send at all? Why are people receiving my messages hours or a day later?
This includes text messages, voice notes and scheduled messages!! Basically the whole use of the app! 

Even when both people are connected to the internet (and other internet-based apps work on their phone) and the app is showing the 1 tick that it is sent. When it’s actually not sent?! When one person sends a voice note or message - sometimes it just disappears into the abyss and never gets delivered at all! Or someone opens up their phone in the morning and suddenly there are heaps of messages from the day before that are only arriving on app open the next day. Last active time is also inaccurate at times. 

It makes no sense that an ‘instant message’ is not being delivered to the receiver either at all or in a delayed manner. This isn’t good enough and frankly quite upsetting when you rely on the app to communicate. It is like missing entire days and chunks of conversations with people.

2021-05-11 00:39:30,"Telegram is the most impressive Messaging app I’ve ever used. Coming from Kik and Discord, I obviously can’t compare it to Whatsapp or Viber, but in my experience Telegram has been everything you could want.

It’s performant and battery conscious, even on my crappy iPhone5S. 

It’s flexible. You can create group chats, group your chats, make secret chats, archive chats, all kinds of stuff.

It’s powerful. It’s got full integration allowing you to send files of any size and then, whatever they are, audio or picture or video, you can view or hear them in app. If they’re not audiovisual, it’s still a great fileshare service for moving documents or zips between phones and computers. 

You get your own seemingly unlimited cloud storage, there’s a million features I don’t use or need that stay out of my way but are there if I need them, the size of the app is still small regardless of that. 

The devs never stop squashing bugs and adding functionality where it’s needed, and they listen to users on what they should add.

2020-06-12 00:32:09,"So, the 3D Touch was changed to Haptic Touch by apple recently and most app developers inclined to adapting to give same experience to their users.
Now, users like Me STILL prefer 3D Touch phones and is the reason why I didn’t upgrade to iPhone 11 because XS has 3D Touch feature and I just can’t give that up.

My point- earlier when telegram made use of the 3D Touch feature in their app, if I 3D Touched and press(message bubble) with little force, it would pop the bubble and MAKE the background(chat) little blurry. Further, if I pressed harder the bubble would simply start to drag to the middle of the screen and the background being blurrier(depending on the amount of pressure I apply). This HELPED Me take screenshots of just the message bubble I wish to be highlighted(WITHOUT THE OPTIONS ON THAT BUBBLE). Now, there’s only 1 thing that would happen i.e; the bubble would be dragged to the middle and it drops down the message options- forward, delete, copy, etc
