This frustrates me as it's been happening since last year around November/December and I've re uploaded images multiple times and have the same problem. I don't understand why the app does it but there would be no point in posting an image if it turns out blurry a week later. Also the same with Instagram stories 75% of the time they come out blurry when using other techniques to the image. Another issue that's very bothering is having multiple adds pop up a day. The adds have became annoying and usually when I've wanted to find other pages I would go in the search bar area. When you follow so many pages or less, seeing multiple adds come up Especially after a busy day are becoming annoying when search down your feed.

2022-12-17 22:59:11,"Whilst Instagram is one of the social media platforms I prefer it does have some annoying features that are absent. The easiest that should be added is an indication next to a persons name as to whether they are one of your followers are not. Such a simple fix and could save a lot of time going through feeds. Another huge change that’s long overdue is the resolution and full screen viewing of photos. Come on already. The app is about sharing photos and we are still stuck with crappy cropped, low resolution photos that you can’t see in full screen. Stop trying to make Instagram what it isn’t with paying more attention to reels and get with what people want it for. Or sit back and watch other apps take over your space.

I add on to my review the number of restrictions Instagram automatically applies to peoples accounts. If you like and follow to many peoples pages (the entire point of Instagram) you get restrictions. If you try to manage your own account and unfollow or block to many people you get restricted. So whilst they make money from your creative content they restrict how you even manage it.",5,False,Madredmini,Needs a total overhaul!!!
2022-07-04 17:05:38,"Hi, I have non epileptic seizures (seizures that mimic epileptic seizures without sending electrical currents through the brain and instead is caused by something functional in the brain). Triggers for these seizures can include ✨strobe lights✨. Lately I have been coming across more and more videos that include strobe lights without the use of flash warnings and I usually comment to politely ask to add a warning however in some cases comments will be disabled or the creator with refuse to put a warning. I know that this isn’t Instagrams fault but I have some ideas to help reduce the risk of seizures from videos containing strobe. 

I feel as if Instagram should add a feature to report videos containing flash to hide the video from photosensitive viewers much like the warnings used for graphic material. This can help protect ourselves from future seizures and flair ups. I know that some people think this might be a dumb request “there aren’t warnings in the real world” “toughen up and get over it” but the thing is that this IS the real world, we can’t get over it because that’s just our life. For some people no flash warnings can be a matter between life or death. You’re playing with peoples lives here. People with seizures have gone through so much trauma, experiencing seizures are terrifying no matter how many you may get. 

Please consider this feature, I’ve had enough of this, and I am so tired. This is so important to us",3,False,Da Pig Luva,Important request
2023-11-26 16:19:24,"My biggest issue with Instagram lately is their application of community guidelines. They seem very inconsistent and biased- strictly following the guidelines with some content but not other similar content, especially when it comes to “political” content... this can greatly affect what content you are allowed to see, comment on, post and share. The “fact check” feature also seems to be bias on particular things.

Reporting content and comments that are not appropriate, especially things regarding bullying and discrimination, or fake/scam accounts pretending to be other people, seems to do very little most of the time, and nothing is usually done about the post/comment you report- only suggesting you block the person you have reported, which doesn’t always fix the issue. The process for reporting things like people stealing your content (copyright infringement) and/or invading your privacy, while generally more effective and successful than the conventional way of reporting things, is also much more difficult- it’s hard to find where and how to send reports directly this way, and is more time consuming. 

The live streams always seem to be glitchy and troublesome, both for the host of the lives and the viewers. Editing reels and stories can also be a pain, with additional features not always loading, things being out of time after uploading, sound playing but the video being frozen, or the app crashing all together and randomly shutting down.",1,False,Watermelon lover 🍉,Glitchy and inconsistent

i understand that the app ‘tiktok’ has created a huge competition, but that doesn’t justify all the social media apps copying them and turning their apps into the same thing. i was fine with reels even though i didnt use them, but when i saw that Instagram wanted to become more video based i knew it was going to go downhill. whats the point of having 5 different social media apps if now they’re all just video applications that fill up your screen? 

instagram was my favorite app to use since it was the most simple, with not many changes and looked refined with the format posting and the dimensions. now with the full screen dimension the colors are just way to contrasting and chaotic. not to mention it doesnt make me want to keep scrolling. the white inbetween the posts on the home page was much better, and i honestly think the new version is atrocious 😄 not to mention, the feed just looks out of place and doesn’t look good. for a multi billion dollar company i was expecting a much more refined and professional media design than what we got. although i understand that this might be a temporary design, i still think that it was muuuuch better before, and many can agree with me.",3,False,iits_becky,horrible update

2024-08-13 12:08:08,"I have always loved the idea of Instagram. I think the concept, what they have done in the social media sphere is amazing but I think there are ways we could make social media “healthier”. It can be so hard for some people to have social media and not get sucked into a never ending rabbit hole. The results can be that people end up not living their life because hours and hours are spent scrolling, addicted to their phone. I understand social media is a large part of how a lot of people make their income but for many, it is a way to keep in touch with friends and search up new friends, be artistic, post life updates, message and so on. 

I would love to see a function on Instagram in the settings that allows the user (or even parents of kids) to disable the discovery page function. I think it would prevent the endless scrolling you can get sucked into. It would still allow you to search for accounts and friends but you’re not exposed to everything and everyone the algorithm sends your way. I think it would make a huge difference to some users experience on the app, in a positive way.

2024-07-05 03:24:07,"I am an avid instagram user and love the app. There are a few simple changes though which would vastly improve the UX for visual collectors. Change request 1) As a user who creates overlapping collections, I want Instagram to enable me to save a post to multiple collections without using a long hold of the save button and extra clicks. This is so that I don’t accidentally unsave my posts if my long click glitches (often the case) and so I don’t need to incorporate several extra clicks to save to multiple collections. Previously this was enabled for and it was so much better than the new meta version. 2) As a user who saves posts to multiple collections, I would love if Instagram could please change the save functionality to enable us to save the specific slide in a post as the cover slide in our saved collections as often the slides in a post have no correlation and the other slides are not relevant which muddles our saved collections. E.g. someone may have a dump of photos in a post and one has an outfit picture; another of flowers; family; kitchen etc and if the front is the family then it often has no correlation to a saved collection on “outfits” or “interior design - living spaces”.",3,False,natasha___,Saved Posts UX Please Fix
2022-01-23 04:49:56,"so I think this app is really well made. 5 stars, however the story drafts disappear. If this could be changed that would be amazing. Also on someone’s profile it has a list of your mutual friends who follow them which is annoying because it takes away from their profiles image. For example you can’t see the posts and you have to scroll down. Another thing is that everyone is getting hacked and I’m worried that I’ll be next. Like they are having to make new accounts because the hackers are controlling their previous account and tricking people into buying things and clicking on these links. For example they are saying ‘I spent a long time on this for you’ or ‘ help me please, I’m in trouble’ with a link attached.

2019-03-02 03:04:09,"I’m not a huge fan of social media, however, Instagram is the one app I prefer using for my artwork aside from Tumblr. 
The photo upload quality both on the Instagram stories and posts could definitely use some work, though. It’s horrible and ruins the look of my art, which is particularly irritating regarding detail shots and the like. Pictures turn out quite grainy and just very unpleasant to look at; almost as though I didn’t detail it at all, which is really quite upsetting honestly. Especially when you spend so many hours on something and you’re very proud of it, wanting to show off all the details you put into it.
Another pet peeve is how Instagram is extremely demanding of your time. Not everyone likes to or can be active online so much, and it seems purposely designed (obviously) to make sure you log in and post everyday; otherwise your views and page visits go down. I don’t often finish a lot of my art in one day, it can take days or weeks and I struggle to get it seen when I post it as well; probably because of whatever algorithm you guys are using. Please take into consideration the people who can’t be online all day everyday and make some compromises.

You’d think Meta would be technologically advanced enough to block bots and scammers but it’s just a marketing forum disguised as a social media platform now. The IG help pages are not helpful and the links don’t work and I’ve emailed them with no reply. This also seems to be a great tactic to get users to pay for a verified IG account (blue tick) for a more promised ‘secure account’.

However, the comment function on Instagram is one of the worst I’ve experienced. There are very view options for formatting a comment and you cannot link anything.

If you want to see replies to a comment you have made, all of the previous comments will be made inaccessible, and if you want to see previous comments when you have replied, all later responses will be inaccessible.

I’ve noticed the app withholds the dopamine hit from seeing the red dot that indicates ppl have liked your posts until you’ve checked the app a couple times that day already; if you check it earlier, the likes are there, but really, that validation is just another tool in the quest to retain as much of your attention as possible.
Even beyond theses criticisms, for an image-centric platform, Instagram stores very low quality jpeg images, with some kind of automatic sharpen/contrast filter that makes non-photographic images look particularly bad.

As i was putting  it together, I realized that I needed Instagram for it. I have never once in my life used instagram and I don’t think i’ll use it again. I began creating my account and ended up at typing in my birthday and it didn’t let me. It kept reseting everytime i typed it in. I eventually gave up and clicked skip ( or next i cant remember ). I was now at the user part when it glitched and wouldn’t let me type, then kicked me out. 4  times i had to do this. 4! I tried one more time and got in. Clicked plus, and ha no idea what to do.

I run all the promotions for my business through Instagram but the promotion payments don’t come out straight away. It doesn’t specify when they come out, only at some random date that you can’t promote anymore because you owe payments. When you try to pay for them, a blank screen with “try again later” comes up. When it finally works, you owe about 10 promotions all at once and it doesn’t allow you to make the full payment. Only success I’ve had is processing a couple of dollars at a time which takes a painstaking amount of time that I could be using to do more constructive things for my business.

Then when I’m on someone’s account it’s the same on there too!

Plus when I’m trying to type text into my post I don’t have access to the full text box as it keeps dropping down the screen so it’s like out of view and I got to keep scrolling down with my finger to see what I’m typing!

Focusing on videos - 9:16 frame, when captions are added at the bottom of your post, as you scroll down the feed you lose the bottom quarter of image/video unless you tap into it or zoom. You also notice because of the caption there is a slight grey wash over the entire image ( again unless you zoom or tap into it) which is ridiculous for an app that is based upon “seeing an image you love and connecting with it straight away” … I think it’s a pathetic tiktok dupe update and needs major tweaking to be original",1,False,SttttttttttttttC,#makeinstagramgreatagain

I am writing to express my frustration and disappointment regarding the issues I have been experiencing with uploading photos on Instagram. I have been a loyal user of Instagram for many years, and I have never had any problems uploading photos until recently.

I have been attempting to upload photos to my Instagram account for the past few days, but the photos have not been uploading successfully. I have tried to upload the photos multiple times, but each time I get an error message stating that the upload was unsuccessful.

2023-09-25 13:58:18,"Hi so i have a private acc on this app and I’m always getting requests from $3x bots and added into groups with them

First of all I think before instagram does anything they need to check for potential adding of minors to possibly real or fake $3x chats on dm and also make sure that if there are minors on the app that they can stay safe and not get requests or groups with them

Secondly instagram needs to start checking accounts for kids that look 10 and under. I am always seeing little kids on instagram reels and they always get butchered in comments. What I’m more concerned about is what I said above with $3x bots when u have a public account u can easily follow someone but with private not so much. I just think that Insta needs to look out for minors because other you have hidden $3x bots and potential predators in their following.

So what I’m trying to say is that for minors on Instagram they should add something for just minors on private where Instagram can see accounts before they try to follow you so they know they can’t be potential $3x bots and if instagram sees any minors on a public account(10-5) in this case especially to maybe have a self private account that instantly turns the account private

2022-05-31 00:50:35,"The recent update is spoiling my enjoyment of beautiful images and stories on Instagram. 

Before, you could enjoy the images in all their glory, most of them carefully photographed and edited to look good just as they are. Then you could go on to read the text underneath, clearly readable on a white background.

Now, every image looks duller with the annoying shading at the bottom. You can’t see the image in it’s entirety when the caption is superimposed over the bottom section of the photo. You also can’t see the text in it’s entirety as you have to carefully scroll through it on top of the picture, a couple of lines at a time. It’s also now harder to swipe through multiple images in one post.

This unnecessary update will have two effects on the Instagram community. Photographers will now have to think about how to get around this, instead of simply posting images in their own right.

Additionally, the interface is just plain boring. It’s a huge downgrade from what was once clean cut and modern. It’s now difficult to use for new users and current users alike. With content being cut off and a complete change between what version people are using.

Also forgot to mention that when tagging people Instagram no longer shows where a poster placed the tag. So in a sea of faces you don’t know who’s who at all. It just gives you a list of tagged people even though when posting, the app gives you an option to place the specific tag.

While this visual platform has some amazing features and tools and is one of the only platforms that you can still reach your target audience without spending money, it’s becoming less and less so. 

Reach has decreased, hashtags are working at seldom, the insights and tools for managing your account are poor and undeveloped. All the time that is put into great new features feels pointless when Instagram is not working like it used to and you can’t manage account without external apps. And now that we can’t use those this platform is too time consuming with less results. 

Instagram would be smart to listen to what we need. Here are few examples: 
- best performing hashtags from the ones we use
- more accurate best time to post 
- better follower management tools (who are my top fans, inactive accounts & ghost followers) 
- line breaks!! how hard is it to do? 
- filter accounts based on location, gender 
- banned hashtag checker 

If Instagram invests in education on how to use their platform more people will do the right thing and there would be less spam and TOS breaking activity.

Not just me either. Thousands of artists of every kind are being trampled by this update. Only 10% of their accounts’ followers will only be able to see their posts? Because it isn’t deemed ‘instagram worthy’?? Artists rely on the traffic of their posts and because of this new algorithm their work is being shoved out of sight. It isn’t fair to them and it isn’t fair to anyone really. No one will probably bother reading this but I get the feeling this update will take that precious #1 down a few notches.

2019-11-22 09:34:27,"Hello there guys, Look I’ve noticed an annoying change you’ve made to your app that I hope you might be able to change or correct. 

You’ve recently moved the “like” heart icon to the top right of the app and the “message” icon where that “like” heart use to be and what I’ve noticed that say you’re scrolling down looking at posts & someone likes your post, comment etc when you go to click that “heart” icon it automatically puts you right back to the top of where to started when looking at posts rather than leaving you where you were up too if that makes sense.... 

It’s the same like when your looking at posts & press the “Instagram” logo it takes you right back to the top of the last post shown prior to the posts refreshing with the most recent posts from ppl you follow.... 

This never use to happen with what I’ve mentioned above, So could you please put the “like” icon and “message” icon back as they were or make it so that when you click the heart icon to look at notifications/likes etc that you aren’t put back to the start....Thank you.",4,False,~Ashman83~,Change of “Like” and “Message” icons

Calling out any of these practices will get you banned or at least temporarily suspended any comment calling out people abusing children is removed and no matter how many times you report images they are never removed. Photos of children being undressed in bed by adult men are apparently “not against their guidelines” and after I tried to get the photo removed my account I’d had for 10 years was taken down without warning! All I had done was try to get a P3D0phile removed from posting and instead I was removed. Their “spam comment” algorithm is a lie and it targets specific people with specific views it’s a morally decayed practice that continually stops people for days-weeks at a time from replying to any comments they are tagged in.

2022-05-08 15:17:55,"New version which I was forcibly changed to on 9th May and which I have unfortunately been selected for is horrible. 
1. Clunky to scroll. When you scroll it pauses at each photo instead of a proper scroll. Slows scrolling to the point of frustration. 
2. The message posted with each photo now sits within the image and as you scroll to read complete post it covers the image with no recourse to collapse the words. 
3. Save icon removed. One of the key reasons I use Instagram is for ideas and suppliers for building a new house. The save icon is overt and I use it daily. This is now gone. I now have to tap at the top of each image, select save but the system doesn’t allow me to select a file to save to. It just goes into the ‘abyss’ until you double tap ( only discovered by accident) to assign to a save folder. 4. The sheer volume of sponsored posts are just too much and prevent me seeing my regular follows. I don’t want to look at an app that is purely showing sponsored suggestions with the occasional sprinkle of what I choose to follow.

2022-02-06 15:45:30,"As much as I love instagram, it’s honestly shocking how iPad still doesn’t have a decent app for it considering its popularity. 
For so long, the iPad app has just been the iPhone app with a big border around it to fit the resolution, which was fine albeit a bit annoying to type on, but the recent landscape update is absolutely terrible. Its just a tiny vertical screen sideways, shrunken down to fit the screen. Its so lazy and buggy, I’m honestly shocked iPad instagram could get any worse.
When you use instagram in landscape mode the keyboard and camera stays vertical, meaning you have to change to vertical to use it anyways— which is really annoying for iPad users who keep their device on rotation lock in landscape (or for the many people who use landscape mode regularly in general). I would take the default vertical screen over this any day. This is just like a bad emulation of a phone on iPad.

I did not dare to look at the comments as I was afraid my worse fears were true, this Instagram content is harbouring harmful content to an extensively large audience from older viewers to children. Comment sections become grounds for sharing names to the source material.

2. Your photo, video and audio quality isn’t very good. In fact, it’s a massive issue. Please make it so that your app doesn’t ruin the quality of mine, and many others posts

 And when you report stuff, like porn, Instagram doesn’t always remove it. It just says “this post doesn’t violate our guidelines” which is frustrating because Instagram should be a safe place for people young and old.

The heart and soul of Instagram was about sharing photos then it developed further to allow videos and over time the ads crept in. To place a reels section where the upload button used to be and a shop button where notifications used to be is ridiculous. Please revert back to the previous layout. It’s very frustrating to click and be taken to a page you have no interest or intention of going to.

First of all, I don’t think that this should be something that affects every Instagram user. I feel like my parents are ‘banning’ me from something or I’m getting punished. I understand why Instagram chose to do this (mental health reasons), but I don’t think it’s fair that everyone has to deal with it. There should be a new feature where you can turn people viewing your amount of likes off like you can with comments. 

Second of all, this update has even affected me viewing my own likes. On two of my posts, I can’t even view whose liked my post let alone the number. Hopefully this glitch/bug will get fixed because it is extremely inconvenient.

To those who do find this essential, why is the fact that you can view how many likes your own post received insufficient? Is there some conceited pleasure to derive from surpassing others in this way?

2023-03-30 10:00:07,"It is disappointing to learn that Instagram's parent company, Meta, is reportedly lobbying the US government to ban TikTok and restrict free speech, which goes against the fundamental values of the First Amendment. Such actions are not only concerning but also highlight the potential misuse of power by large tech corporations.

In light of these reports, it is difficult to overlook the unethical and hypocritical behavior of Instagram's ownership. While Instagram claims to support the values of free expression and creativity, its parent company's actions contradict those claims.

Furthermore, Instagram's user experience has been plagued by a barrage of targeted advertisements, algorithmic biases, and fake accounts, making it difficult for users to trust the platform. The constant pressure to present a ""perfect"" life through curated photos and videos can also take a toll on users' mental health.

Overall, it is disheartening to see a once-popular social media platform like Instagram being associated with such negative actions and behaviors.

Many fan accounts put so much work into their posts/edits and then eventually get taken down for nothing and most of the time they lose all their followers and work.

Why is it that when I’m just scrolling and trying to find updates from people I actually follow, that there are now suggested reels and suggested posts that alter the screen brightness of the app to make you focus on them?

Can you also please make the feature that allows you to see a certain type of feed permanently your preference?
