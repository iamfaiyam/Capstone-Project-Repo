2020-06-04 03:41:05,"The functionality and feature parity of Teams is really good across platforms. But the quality of the apps is pretty poor.

Whilst I can handle some rough edges the main deal breaker right now on iOS is the battery drain - it‚Äôs terrible, my iPad was burning through it‚Äôs battery (usually it‚Äôs great) and when I checked the battery usage it was about 70% Teams which was very unreasonable since I‚Äôd only had a short audio call and otherwise the odd text chat. 

My other general annoyance is the theme switching to dark is very clunky - it crashes and reloads the app by design! And this doesn‚Äôt seamlessly switch like most native apps when iOS switches.

Overall I wish some more care was put into the native iOS app - that battery drain is a serious issue - I need to use this on the go with confidence and I can‚Äôt right now.",5,False,mattjenb,Battery Drain and no auto dark mode
2020-06-02 09:24:41,This app is really helpful and I love it. But for some reason no matter what image I use I can't change my profile picture. I have even tried doing another way which was updating the profile picture on office 365 since teams and office 365 are connected and nothing has worked. I try to do this at least once a weak but nothing happens. Even when I press that check for updates button . I still doesn't register anything. Also when you update the profile picture though office 365 all the office 365 apps related to it are supposed to update their profile picture and none have updated. When i go into the edit profile picture settings in office 365 it shows that I have saved and I has updated the photo. I have had a look on the internet and I have found that a lot of people are having exactly the same issue. So I would nice if you could try and fix the bug. Because that would be a really good feature to have when you have multiple people in a meeting and you will be able to straight away tell who it is. Apart from that the app is perfect. That is why I am giving it 4 out of 5 stars.,4,False,JamesTClolXR,Just one major bug
2023-04-03 07:51:07,"I support teams in a SME environment. It‚Äôs a great app & this review is not so much about Teams itself but M365. There is widespread confusion in our organisation about what Teams is. The fact that you can use Teams as a way to navigate to files stored in SharePoint & then open those files inside in Teams makes people think the files are in Teams when they aren‚Äôt. A lot of people don‚Äôt understand that when using Teams to find files that those files should then be opened in SharePoint & not in Teams because if they are looking at a document in Teams, that document hogs the App & if they need to join a team meeting in Teams they then need to abandon the opened document. There is also confusion about the OneDrive app, which keeps your local OneDrive & Synched SharePoint folders synched with their cloud counterparts and OneDrive Personal File Storage.

2021-08-04 04:46:35,"Teams is really super, but it desperately needs to be a multiple document interface style application where you can have multiple things open at the same time.  If you‚Äôre having a meeting and reviewing a task list, navigating to a document that you want to discuss, you have to navigate back to where you were and that‚Äôs all too clumsy.  If you had the ability to minimise what you‚Äôre looking at, follow a link, bring up a calendar, etc. and just tab between the open items within the app, it would become super useful.
Otherwise, I say the concept is great and it occupies a fantastic place between an inbox, calendar, shared folders, workflow manager and IM.  It is everything that an actual team needs.

The second thing is logging back in my account. When I try to log back in it takes me millions of tries to back in.
