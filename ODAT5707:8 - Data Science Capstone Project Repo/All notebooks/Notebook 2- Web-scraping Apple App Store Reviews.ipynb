      "Review: The privacy on WhatsApp is incredible, I know you probably don‚Äôt have time for young girls but basically my whole year level agrees to make it more like snap, not fully copy right but try and change the status so it isn‚Äôt so embarrassing when you add to itüëç Also if you do change it we have all agreed to spread the word, you know tell everyone to get it because it‚Äôs better than snap, hahahaha!!! Also you should add a camera simble next to all the chats so you can just click on that and send a specific photo to each chat, instead of changing it in settings every timeüò´ another good reason is because Snapchat is 17+ or something so basically no one is allowed it, if you include these simple things then it might just be the next big app, isn‚Äôt that what you want??? I know exactly what your thinking why would any idiot like me waste all of this time just for a comment? Well because it‚Äôs not just me talking about this, it‚Äôs the whole freakin school!! Even the teachers, I am only 16, I don‚Äôt expect you to just go and change it but at least try!! Why save the best till last, it‚Äôs worth a crack isn‚Äôt it?? And if it doesn‚Äôt work, just change it back no biggy, and I know I have no idea what I am taking about it‚Äôs probably a lot harder than I think it is but just have a go!! You only have one life so why not try and live it instead of trying to survive it???\n",

      "This app is really great, I use it everyday and is exactly what I need! It is a basic app for messaging, but with so many advanced features!\n",
      " However, I think a really good improvement for this app would be to have information on photos you send. So if you click on your photo either on a chat or status, you can find out who saved or took a screenshot of it. This would be very beneficial for many users, and enhance the app even more! One more thing that would be great to be able to do is delete photos, even if everyone has viewed it. Every person I‚Äôve talked to wants this feature, and it would be helpful for personal, non business related chats. So once everyone has viewed it, you could still go back and delete it before more people save it. I would love to see these as an addition for WhatsApp, as it is such a great app! Thanks for your time!\n",

Their customer support sends autogenerated responses that dont address my problem. Im unbanned and them banned again within a day or two, with no explanation or cause. This has been incredibly disruptive to my trip and its a real shame this app is so ubiquitous when its treating its customers so poorly.\n",

I am just trying to reach out to hotels, travel agents etc while travelling. Im doing nothing untoward or remotely spammy. Each time ive been unbanned 24hrs later and it is explained as an ‚Äúaccident‚Äù, then i am immediately rebanned. No human support to help me, just the same loop of dealing with robots. Im in a foreign country and unable to talk to many businesses and services who exclusively use this terrible app putting my safety at risk.\n",
